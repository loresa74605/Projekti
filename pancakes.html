    <h1>What Fruity Pancakes taste like</h1>
    <p>Fruity pancakes taste soft, fluffy, and gently sweet. The pancakes themselves have a warm, comforting flavour, while the fruit adds a fresh, juicy sweetness and a light tang that balances everything nicely. Each bite feels light and refreshing, with the fruit enhancing the taste without overpowering the pancakes. Overall, they taste bright, smooth, and satisfying—perfect for a sweet but not too heavy treat.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients for Fruity Pancakes</h1>
     <img src="panIngredients.png" alt="">
    <p>Plain/all-purpose flour, sifted to keep the batter smooth.Sugar just a little to lightly sweeten without overpowering.
    Eggs - provide structure and help the pancakes hold together.Milk thins the batter for a soft, tender texture.
    Water lightens the batter so the pancakes aren't heavy.Oil keeps the pancakes soft and moist.
    Butter used in the pan to create golden edges and add rich flavour.</p>
    <h2>1.MAKING THE BATTER</h2>
    <img src="step1.2.png" alt="">
    <p>Sift flour into a large mixing bowl. Add sugar and salt, then whisk to combine.</p>
    <p>Make a well in the centre and add the eggs. Whisk gently and only mix in a bit of the flour. You can't blend all the flour with just the eggs yet, so just mix in enough to make a thick paste.</p>
     <img src="step3.4.png" alt="">
    <p>Gradually add the milk, whisking between each addition. It will let the batter turn silky and lump-free. It should feel smooth and light, almost like pouring cream.</p>
    <p>Whisk in the water and oil until shiny and lump-free. The water lightens the batter, it will help having thin crêpes but still flexible, while the oil keeps them soft and prevents sticking.</p>
    <img src="step5.6.png" alt="">
    <p>Rest for 1 hour covered, on the counter at room temperature. The batter will thicken a little as it rests, this resting step relaxes the gluten, the flour absorbs the liquid, so the crêpes cook up soft and never rubbery.</p>
    <p>After resting, the batter should be smooth, a bit thicker, and perfectly pourable.</p>
    <h2>2.COOK THE CREPES</h2>
     <img src="first.png" alt="">
    <p>Heat a 24cm / 9.5″ non-stick crêpe pan over medium-high heat (medium if your stove runs hot). If you don't have one, any good non-stick pan will work, just adjust how much batter you pour in depending on the size, so it spreads nicely without being too thick or thin.</p>
    <p>Melt about ½ tsp butter, then wipe it off with a paper towel, you just want a little butter left for flavour, no visible pools. If you leave too much butter, it will stop the batter from spreading evenly. The butter gives flavour and a touch of crispness around the edges.</p>
    <img src="second.png" alt="">
    <p>Pour the batter: using a ladle, scoop up ¼ cup of batter, lift the pan off the heat, ladle most of the batter into the centre, and immediately swirl the pan so the batter coats the surface in a thin, even layer. Still while swirling, use the rest of the batter to fill up the empty spots before it sets. Tilting quickly gives you uniform crêpes.</p>
    <p>Cook for 45 seconds to 1 minute until the underside turns pale golden with light brown speckles.</p>
    <img src="third.png" alt="">
    <p>Flip using a long, thin spatula. Slide it gently under the crêpe without tearing the surface, lift and flip. Cook the second side for about 30 seconds. A long, narrow spatula works best for flipping crêpes because it slides under the thin crêpe without tearing it.And don't fear the flip.</p>
    <p>Slide onto a plate and repeat, adding a small bit of butter each time. Stack the crêpes as you go, they'll stay warm and soft. Serve with your preferred fillings or toppings!</p>
